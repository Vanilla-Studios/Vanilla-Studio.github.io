# REASONS FOR ANALYSING DATA
Organisations analyse data to determine how to better tailor and improve their products. They can do this by analysing the data to see who their target audience is, and to better tailor towards them by improving their products and creating new products to take advantage of what they know their target audience might need. Other companies such as Google and Facebook use big data to custom tailor ads to certain people depending on your potential interests gathered by the sites you have visited and terms you have searched; You can see the information that google knows about you from this link <https://bit.ly/GoogleStalkery>; Organisations can use their respective services to advertise their products to online users based on this data. For a charity, acquiring more donors could mean targeting ads towards people with a possible impulsive spending habit or someone that is known to have donated to other charity on a regular basis; This can be done automatically on a large scale.
# GENERAL CHALLENGES
## BUDGET
### ON-SITE SOLUTION
Big data implementation projects require loads of expenses. Implementations that adopt on-site solutions must bear in mind the cost of hardware, personnel and electricity among others. Most frameworks used for data analysis are free/open source but they only provide a foundation which will need to be built upon so the organisation will still need to pay for development, configuration, setup, and continual maintenance.
### CLOUD-BASED SOLUTION
Alternatively, organisations can opt for a cloud-based solution can negate some of the costs from personnel, hardware and electricity. However, trained personnel will still be needed to development of frameworks.

## SECURITY
There are many problems when it comes to security. Here are a few:
### FAKE DATA
To destabilise an organisations big data analysis, cybercriminals can fabricate data for your organisation to collect unknowingly. This can be to create anomalies in an organisations data to confuse analysis from noticing trends and taking on the opportunity to optimise their operations to best take advantage of a situation. An example of this could be tricking an organisation into thinking a product will come into more demand than it will, promoting the organisation into preparing for this event.
### ENCRYPTION
Cryptographic protection (Encryption) is a well-known way of protecting data so that if it did get into the wrong hand, it could not be read without a decryption key. Despite this, many organisations fail to encrypt the data they collect for. The reasoning for many organisations not encrypting their data is because it adds an extra step in handling the data, whenever the data needs to be analysed
### LEGISLATION 
Failure to meet security requirements and preventing data breaches can result in violating the UKs Data Protection Act or the European Unions General Data Protection Regulations which means you can be fined for personal data being leaked.

# TYPES OF DATA
Data is split into categories that define how they expressed or their origin.
## QUALITATIVE
Qualitive data is a descriptive data type that is usually acquired through observation and cannot be quantified. An example of Qualitative Data can include an objects colour, or its size described using an adjective e.g., small or big.
## QUANTITATIVE 
Quantitative data is a data type that is express by numerical values. There are 2 types of quantitative data:
### DISCRETE
Discrete data is information that is fixed, meaning it is defined initially and does not change. An example of this could be the number of employees at a company. Most Discrete data can be represented by a bar chart.
### CONTINUOUS
Continuous data is information that can be expressed by any numerical value. Additionally, continuous data is subject to changes over time. Continuous data can be represented on a line graph with time being along the X-axis.
## INTERNAL
Internal data is a data type that is generated through the observations of an organisation’s internal operations. This data can include information, statistics, and trends pulled from internal databases, software, customers, decision-making and reports.
## EXTERNAL
External data is a data type that is public or generated outside the company; External data is not owned by the company and as a result, has no control of it.
# STORING DATA
## DATA LAKES
A data lake is a repository that allows an organisation to store all their structured and unstructured data. Organisations can store their data in its unmodified or raw format without having to structure it.
## STRUCTURED DATA
Structured data is data that has been processed into a standardised format and has an identifiable structure. This data is usually stored in database.
## UNSTRUCTURED DATA
Unstructured data is data that lacks an identifiable structure and does not conform to a standardised format.
### SOURCES
Sources of unstructured data include:

- Web pages
- Memos
- Reports
- Surveys
- Documents
- Images 
## SYSTEM BASED FACTORS
Storing big data requires systems with allot of performance. Apache Hadoop, a commonly used software solution for storing big data that stores data over a network of computers/servers, requires a system with enough computing power in order to process the data and split it into chunk that can then be spread across the network. As well as computing power, Hadoop requires a massive amount of raw storage space into the petabytes to store the data; to further exacerbate the situation, Hadoop requires extremely fast data mediums for which, it utilizes RAM disks which use the systems memory to store the data instead of the more traditional RAID clusters of hard or solid-state drives; because RAM Disks utilize volatile memory, the data is at risk of loss if the systems do not have a persistent power supply. A common PC can run Hadoop, but it’s recommended to use sandboxed servers with allot of system memory.

# DATA WAREHOUSES AND DATA MARTS
A data warehouse is a repository that uses relational databases to store structured data. This has the disadvantage that data needs to be processed before it can be stored and is only good for structured data.
